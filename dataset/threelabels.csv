NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I am beginning to see the problem you have. You see, you do not know how to read what other people say without attaching your personal bias to it. Never once did I say that ultra-Orthodox Jews have no rabbis or synagogues. I DID say that the role of the rabbi and synagogue in ultra-Orthodox Judaism is minimal when compared with, say, Conservative Judaism. They are not clergy, in the traditional Western sense of the word. That is a fact. As for synagogues, they exist, but they are not essential. Minyan (a quorum of ten adult males in ultra-Orthodox law) is essential. You can have a minyan without a synagogue, but a synagogue without a minyan is an empty building.

If you were to draw such sharp distinctions between ultra-Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism in a recognized Judaic Studies program, they would not know what you are talking about.

C) In cases where things like hashgacha (kosher certification, etc.) are debated, you will find in most cases that it is not a question of responsa. If you know something about responsa literature in general (which apparently you do not), there are degrees of acceptance. For example, halav yisrael (milk under rabbinical supervision during milking to ensure that it comes from a cow). Most modern-Orthodox Jews do not insist on it t on the basis of a responsa by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein who determined that American government supervision is sufficient. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews do insist on it. They do not reject the responsa. In fact, Moshe Feinstein (Reb Moshe, as he was called) was considered the leading halachic authority for the American ultra-Orthodox community in the past fifty years. They will say that the ruling is right BUT they want to be machmir (more strict on themselves, meaning more pious). It is not a rejection. It is simply being stricter.

And militant Islamism (the militant Islamism of bin Laden, the Saudis, Saddam Hussein, the Baathists, and the Palestinian suicide bombers) or Islamofascism is the enemy of freedom and the distilled essence of evil. Totalitarian ideologies and fanaticisms have come in gone and have been defeated by America. All these ideologies are one in the same. They hate modernity, hate America, hate freedom, hate capitalism, hate liberal democracy, and love terrorism, oppression, genoicide, and fanatic hatred. In Germany the tyranical enemies of freedom and capitalism rallied behind Nazism, in Italy they rallied behind fascism, in Russia they rallied behind totalitarian socialism and communism, and now in the Middle East, where a lot of dictators and tyrants are threatened by freedom and American values, they rally behind militant Islamics. It is fact that there isnt a single Arab democracy. Muslim leaders (Saddam was just the worst of the lot. There will be more dictators/terrorists to fight like the Syrians) are all tyrants and terrorists who stifle the free press, kill their own people, crush their citizens hopes and dreams, and want to kill Americans like they did on 9/11. Their desire to kill Americans and supprot terror rests on one deep, abiding hatred: their irrational fear of America, which sticks up for freedom and opposes their tyranny with great scarafices, like America is doing right now defeating evil in the Arab countries of Iraq and Afghnaistan. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ideology of militant Islamist terrorism is the totalitarian enemy that America confronts today. And patriotic Americans say it will be defeated like America defeated totalitarianisms in the past through heroic struggle: Communism, fascism, Nazism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA lot of conservative commentators who speak with moral clarity call America's struggle against the evil of Islamofascist totalitarianism right now World War IV. That this is freedom's fourth struggle against a totalitarian evil. In WWI it was the despotic rule of the Kaiser, in WWII it was the Nazis, in freedom's third struggle it was the communists in the Cold War (although it wasnt a ``hot war`` it was another global stuggle like a world war). Now America's forth stuggle is a worldwide campaign against states like Iraq that hate the free world, kill their own people, desire weapons of mass destruction, and support terrorism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe antiwar liberal left appeases totalitarian evil, which they love to do. They rallied to defend the Communists in Vietnam. Now the amoral liberal left is opposing America's commander in chief George W Bush in his struggle in Iraq. Hundreds of millions were slaughtered (Communism murdered 100 million people while the liberals opposed the Cold War at every step) and Communism threatened the freedom of America and her allies. Conservatives say that America must stop this new totalitarian enemy before its murderous hate claims as many victims as Communism. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`"

personal,"`NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow that the edit war seems to have died down. I just want to add a little about privatization and free market. Even while the neoliberals ofcourse want to put an equal sign between free market and privatization, very few privatizations are ever made that actually increases the competition in the market. Because if the buisness that is sold to private owners has a monopoly before it is sold, it ofcourse will to after it has been privatized. And if the company is sold while it is already subjected to competition it will to after it has been privatized. Indeed, privatization has nothing to do with ``free markets``, but is only a transferment of public property to private hands. Ofcourse that argument will not keep the neoliberals from claiming the Second Return of Messiah as long as we privatize and the Doomsday if we dont. But atleast we do not have to use their rhethorics. `"

And, this situation had been ``rehearsed`` several times from 1992 to 1995, as the repentant Milan Babic (another ex-rebel boss and ICTY indictee) has confessed. Nobody ``drove them out``. That's the fate they themselves had chosen. The central difference lies in the fact that no Croatian military units were involved in forced ``transportation`` or similar stuff. More: during ``Lightning`` and ``Storm`` operations, large-scale negotiations had been held with the representatives of Serbian military & civilian authorities in order to persuade them to stay. To no avail. The siren call of Greater Serbia was stronger. That's the Serb way.

As to right and left wing, I agree the terms should be used with care.

If you can find a source that calls the Spartacists reactionary, or discusses the Freikorps as left liberals, I'd love to see it. You'll note that I didn't reinsert the description of the Nazis themselves as right wing. But I think that saying there are similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, say, is not to deny that Nazism is in some vague sense a movement ``of the right`` and Stalinism a movement ``of the left.`` At any rate, ``what was seen at the time as`` is an incredibly awkward phrasing - it's simply bad writing. As to other changes, things like saying ``this is how the Nazis were different from other Socialists`` is completely POV, in that it says that the Nazis were socialists. And you can't just cite laws as supporting a point without explaining them at all. And it would be nice if you could actually cite scholars who discuss similarities between Nazism and socialism, rather than vague ``supporters`` of such arguments (at the very least, those opposed to such comparisons can cite ``the organized socialist movement`` rather easily, although I would agree that there are somewhat similar problems on that side of the debate.)

I want you to know that despite our disagreements, I really appreciate what you're trying to do. It's difficult for most people to write a truly NPOV article, which is why what Wikipedia does is so great. By having hundreds of thousands of authors, almost every point of view is represented, and people are forced to compromise, usually resulting in pure truth. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnfortunately, the Holocaust is one of the few subjects where this doesn't work. It is a subject which should be purely history. The Nazis kept spectacular notes on everything that they did, and it should be spectacularly easy to say ``this here is exactly what happened. We know, because of the monthly reports written by Himmler.`` Unfortunately, Holocaust deniers continually show up, most of whom have no interest in truth or even compromise. They tend to wipe entire paragraphs, and replace them with their own propaganda. This is just who they are. They cannot provide evidence as convincing a page from Hitler's desk ordering the final solution to ``The Jewish Problem`` so they don't listen or compromise and eventually leave in a bad mood.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt the same time, I can't exactly claim to be NPOV either. It is fairly clear from what I have already written here that I hold Holocaust deniers in no high esteem. Quite frankly, I find their so called ``beliefs`` to be an attack against me and my people. It is, to me, like someone claiming there was never racial segregation in the United States, and that even if there was, the slave owners didn't know their slaves were being beaten. It would be an absolutely ridiculous claim, and yet people get away with it in reference to the Jews. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is good, therefore, that someone has shown up who is interested in this issue, but who has no real stake in the argument. I would caution you, however, against being overly zealous in your changes. Holocaust deniers are, by and large, anti-Semitic. My personal favourite group believes that Jews are shape shifting lizards from Mars who are infiltrating the world governments in order to enslave humanity. And yes, this group has a following. The ``Holocaust Revisionist`` lines and the ``Jewish persecution was wrong`` lines are simply ways of attracting new followers who can then be trained to believe just about anything once they've got their foot in the door. The people running these groups are solely occupied with promoting anti-Semitism in the hopes that some day they can finish off what Hitler started. I encourage you to write carefully about what they believe, but please don't be fooled by them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI wish you the best of luck. `"

I've been trying to think back to when bosses became popular (a mite difficult seeing as I would have been about five years old), and it seems that the flash point is in 1985.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:However, I am quite heavily biased toward scrolling shooters, so I'm probably missing something important. Bosses are, on the other hand, probably more important in scrolling shooters than any other genre, because they have to break up the linearity of the game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Anyway. In 1985, you've that Mario game thingy, and Gradius, which is the first time I can recall having to fight a huge boss character. Then in 1986 you've got Darius, which is the earliest game I know of that had different bosses for every level. I think it had minibosses too.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:And then it really gets going. In 1987, I can name R-Type, Raiden, and Rainbow Islands as having distinct bosses, and by this point it was all pretty standard. But I'm just namedropping (and article-dropping too, seeing as I wrote most of those articles ;) ). The point is that there seems to be a dark age of bosses before 1985, so it would probably be interesting to unravel that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The very earliest enemy-that-could-conceivably-be-thought-of-as-a-boss that I can think of (not including that Dungeons and Dragons thing mentioned in the article, which I know nothing about) is the Flag Ship from Gorf, an arcade game released in 1981, in the prime of the Space Invaders Era. Gorf was like five games in one, and when the player completed a level, they would move onto a level in the next game.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The fifth level was a battle with the Flag Ship. It has all the hallmarks of a boss: It's much bigger than the player's ship, much better armed, has its own forcefield, and is only minorly damaged by the player's weapon. The only way to destroy it is to hit it in its weak spot - a reactor situated deep within the ship.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Now I think about it, I don't know why I didn't mention this before. The thing is, I always thought of the Flag Ship as a 'level' rather than a boss. There wasn't really any concept of a boss at that point in history. Still, it's a start."

What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff). Sign-language? We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress. From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed. I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks. SO what does the IPA do?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: ``if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}```"

personal,"NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhile you are correct that 'toughened glass' could be considered a misnomer (toughness has a specific meaning with regard to the strength of materials), tempering glass is not. In fact there are two ways to temper glass to increase its strength: thermal and chemical. Regarding thermal tempering, you are incorrect that the surface of a glass is in tension even at room temperature. On initial cooling you are correct that the surface is in tension and the interior is in compression. However, below the glass transition temperature the stresses reverse and the surface is in compression and the interior is in tension increasing the strength of the glass. Prince Rupert's drops are a laboratory curiousity demonstrating this phenomena. If a drop of molten glass is cast into a container of water, it solidifies into a shape roughly resembling a tadpole. You can bang on the big end with a hammer and the glass drop will not break. However if you nip the tail, the drop disintegrates into dust usually with a pop. Thermal tempering is usually applied to windshields. Chemical tempering is usually accomplished by ion exchanging a smaller atom for a larger atom at the surface again putting the surface in compression. Although glazing and surface crystallization can also be used. For example, soda-lime-silica glass can be placed into molten potassium nitrate and exchange potassium for sodium in the surface increasing the strength of the glass. Thermal tempering can increase the strength of glass from 70 to 200 MPa while chemical tempering can increase it 500 to 700 MPa. Chemical tempering is commonly used to increase the strength of beverage containers."

Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that ``Joe`` should be used more often in the article than ``Jack`` (though ``the narrator`` fits the character's ``name`` more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book. It would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book, with details on the movie where applicable.
